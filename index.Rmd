# Introduction

This course is targeted at complete R beginners, but you will not be able to learn anything without training.
After this course you will know basic concepts in R and will be able to work with data tables.
But you will forget that soon if you do not use this knowledge at least once a week for about one year (wild guess).

So please dig into your own data as soon as possible. Not during the course though ;-)
 

# Basic data structures

R is a programming language. Therefore you need to store data in data structures that R can understand.
And as data structures are an extremely boring thing without an example we might as well start getting an example dataset.
Having completed the Unix course you should know what you are doing here. Start a Terminal and do this:

```
if [ ! -d ~/NAS/git ]; then
   mkdir ~/NAS/git
fi
cd ~/NAS/git
git clone http://gitlab/stefanlang/R_usageTutorial_1.git
cd R_usageTutorial_1
R
```

Now you have a working R console. You can copy from this document that you also find in the R_usageTutorial_1/index.html using mouse select and middle mouse button insert.

You hopefully still remember the examples from the Unix course? Gtf files?
Lets load one of them 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
