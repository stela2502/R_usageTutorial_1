# Introduction

This course is targeted at complete R beginners, but you will not be able to learn anything without training.
After this course you will know basic concepts in R and will be able to work with data tables.
But you will forget that soon if you do not use this knowledge at least once a week for about one year (wild guess).

So please dig into your own data as soon as possible. Not during the course though ;-)
 

# Basic data structures

R is a programming language. Therefore you need to store data in data structures that R can understand.
And as data structures are an extremely boring thing without an example we might as well start getting an example dataset.
Having completed the Unix course you should know what you are doing here. Start a Terminal and do this:

You all have taken the Unix course before and therefore this should look
familiar. Do you remember where you need to paste that in?

```
if [ ! -d ~/NAS/git ]; then
   mkdir ~/NAS/git
fi
cd ~/NAS/git
git clone http://gitlab/stefanlang/R_usageTutorial_1.git
cd R_usageTutorial_1
R
```

Now you have a working R console. You can copy from this document that you also find in the R_usageTutorial_1/index.html using mouse select and middle mouse button insert.

You hopefully still remember the examples from the Unix course? Gtf files?
Lets load one restricted to only ENSEMBL gene entries:

```{r }

genes <- read.delim( 'data/ENSEMBL_genes.gtf', header=F)
head(genes)

```

OK - great! Learning about data types here - what did we get?

```{r}
class(genes)
```

We will ignore most of the data.frame here, just one thing: You can get subsets
of a table object (matrix, data.farme and others) by writing
object_name[ rowID, colID] e.g genes[,1] to get the first column,
genes[1:10,1] to get the first 10 values from column 1 and so on.

## Vector

We read an object of class 'data.frame'. But I wanted to start with vectors. So
lets get a [vector](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/vector) of start
positions from this data.frame object.

```{r}
vect = as.vector(genes[,4])
length(vect)
```

To be on the save side I have told R to take the 4th column of the
data.table genes and convert it to a vector. I have saved the resulting vector
with 13139 gene start positions into the variable 'vect'. 
And we could create a histogram of all start positions:

```{r}
hist(vect, breaks=100)
```

We nbow created a histogram of the start positions of all genes on all 
chromosomes. But this is missleading as we have the start positions of all
genes in the genome relative to the chromosome. If we would like to visualize
the start positions relative to the chromosomes we would need to split the start
position into separate vectors for each chromosome.


## List

We need to store the start positions of a unknown genes per chromosome,
preferably in one object and not a long list of separate objects. I recommend to
put all chromosome specific gene start positions into a new [R
list object](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/list). A list in R can
contain objects of any class and size. Here we need to store the per chromosome
start positions in the list. And there is a function to create this list in R:
split().


```{r}
?split

per_chr <- split( vect, as.vector( genes[,1]))
class(per_chr)
names(per_chr)

lapply( per_chr, length)
```

The function lapply does apply a R function (length) onto a R list (per_chr)
and you see the result.

Now we can produce a histogram of all genes from chr1.

```{r}
hist( per_chr[['chr1']], breaks=100)
```

## Factor

Factors are a huge source for problems in R. I have spend hours to look for
errors in my scripts that bioled down to using an factor instead of a vector of
strings.

Factors store a vector of integers and a string level for these. This level is
what it does sort the vector on and if you use a factor in a numericx context
the strings get replaced by the numeric id of the string in the levels.

An example where you would probably expect a different order:

```{r}
newFactor <- factor( c('B','C','D','A','A','A','B'))
table(newFactor)
```

The newFactor is sorted in a lexial order, not in the order of appearance in
the vector. That is sometimes good sometimes not what you expect.
You can also force an order into a factor:

```{r}
states = factor( c('LT-HSC', 'ST-HSC', 'Early MPP', 'Late MPP') )
sort(states)
## Not what you want?
states = factor( c('LT-HSC', 'ST-HSC', 'Early MPP', 'Late MPP'), levels= c('LT-HSC', 'ST-HSC', 'Early MPP', 'Late MPP'))
sort(states)
```

But adding something new to a factor is complicated - I normally re-create them.

```{r}
states[5] = 'CLP'
states
```

The fifth element is 'NA' instead of 'CLP'. To add the 'CLP' into your factor
you need to re-create it:

```{r}
states = factor( c(as.vector(states), 'CLP') , levels=c('LT-HSC', 'ST-HSC', 'Early MPP', 'Late MPP', 'CLP') )
states
```

The chromosome information in the genes data.frame is a factor. Try to re-order
it.

Better break that up into more steps:

```{r}
## get the old factor as vector
Strings = as.vector(genes[,1])
old_levels = levels(genes[,1])
old_levels
## for the lacy ones
paste ( old_levels, collapse="', '" )
reordered = c( 'chr1', 'chr10', 'chr11', 'chr12', 'chr13', 'chr14', 'chr15', 'chr16', 
		'chr17', 'chr18', 'chr19', 'chr2', 'chr3', 'chr4', 'chr5', 'chr6', 'chr7', 
		'chr8', 'chr9', 'chrM', 'chrX', 'chrY')

reordered = c( 'chr1', 'chr2', 'chr3', 'chr4', 'chr5', 'chr6', 'chr7', 
		'chr8', 'chr9','chr10', 'chr11', 'chr12', 'chr13', 'chr14', 'chr15', 'chr16', 
		'chr17', 'chr18', 'chr19', 'chrX', 'chrY',  'chrM')
## now we can re-create the factor in the table:
genes[,1] <- factor(Strings, levels= reordered )

table(genes[,1])

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
